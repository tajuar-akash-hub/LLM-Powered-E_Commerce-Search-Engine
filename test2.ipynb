      "1. One theory is that the name \"Dhaka\" comes from the Dhakeshwari temple, which is a famous Hindu temple in the city. The temple is dedicated to the goddess Dhakeshwari, and the city may have been named after it.\n",
      "2. Another theory is that the name \"Dhaka\" is derived from the Bengali word \"ঢাক\" (Ḍhāk), which means \"hidden\" or \"covered\". This theory suggests that the city was named \"Dhaka\" because it was a hidden or covered place, possibly due to its location in a bend of the Buriganga River.\n",
      "3. A third theory is that the name \"Dhaka\" comes from the name of a local ruler, Dhaka Ray, who is said to have founded the city in the 7th century.\n",
